## INTER-VLAN Routing and Trunking Configurations Lab
This lab is my practice on how to configure VLANs in Cisco Packet Tracer.
The goal is to separate devices into different networks (FINANCE and MARKETING), and then use a router (Router-on-a-Stick) to allow communication between them.


## Steps Followed
1. Network Topology Setup
   - One switch
   - One router
   - Four PCs (2 in FINANCE VLAN, 2 in MARKETING VLAN)

2. Switch Configuration
