## Dynamic Routing (EIGRP) Configuration

This project demonstrates **Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP)** configuration between routers in Cisco Packet Tracer.  
The goal was to enable automatic route sharing between both networks using EIGRP - a fast and efficient dynamic routing protocol.

## Steps Followed
   - Two switches
   - Two routers (R1 and R2)
   - Four PCs
   - Connected devices on each network
   - Connected both routers with serial DTE cable
