## Dynamic Routing (RIP) Configurations
This lab demonstrates dynamic routing with the RIP protocol between two routers in Cisco Packet Tracer.  
The goal was to make different networks communicate automatically, without manually adding static routes.

## Steps Followed 
1. Network Topology Setup
   - Two routers
   - Two Switches
